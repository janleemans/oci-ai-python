# Exploring the Oracle AI services through the python SDK

## Introduction
Leveraging the Oracle AI services directly from an application is simple! This tutorial will help you get up and running fast with the basic AI services available on Oracle OCI, calling them from a python environment.  I chose to use a Jupyter notebook because that allowed the easiest interaction and step-by step execution of the various pieces of code, and it allows for easy copying of the API calls you want to use straight into your actual application.

So which services will you be discovering?
•	AI Language Service: this service allows to do language detection, text sentiment analysis and translations between a large set of languages,
•	AI Vision service: the service allows to detect object, faces and text in image files,
•	AI Speech: allows you to transcribe sound of a video into a text file.

We’ll also be using the identity services as well as the object storage service to manipulate files.
